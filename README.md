# Expose capabilities of SAP AI Core with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

## Description

This repository contains the material for the "Expose SAP AI Core capabilities with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model" CodeJam, brought to you by the Developer Advocates at SAP.

## Overview

This CodeJam introduces attendees to aspects of exposing generative artificial intelligence (genAI) capabilities to execute tasks in a business context.

During this event, you'll become acquainted with the theory behind genAI, SAP AI Core and how you can use the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model to expose AI capabilities through your own service application.

In working through the exercises you'll become comfortable with creating CDS based service definitions, integration into SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and SAP AI Core Foundation Models.

## Session prerequisites

In order to get the most from this CodeJam, and to be able to work through the exercises, there are certain prerequisites that you must have sorted out before the day of the CodeJam.

The prerequisites are detailed in a separate [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file. Please ensure you have everything ready before attending the CodeJam.

## Exercises

These are the exercises, each in their own directory, sometimes with supporting files and scripts. We will work through the exercises in the order shown here. From a session flow perspective, we are taking the "coordinated" approach:

The instructor will set you off on the first exercise, and that's the only one you should do. Do not proceed to the next exercise until the instructor tells you to do so.

## Feedback

If you can spare a couple of minutes at the end of the session, please help us improve for next time by providing some feedback.

Simply use this [Give Feedback](https://github.com/SAP-samples/codejam-cap-llm/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=session-feedback-template.md&title=Session%20Feedback) link to create a special "feedback" issue, and follow the instructions in there.

Thank you!
